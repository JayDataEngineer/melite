//
// coverage-baseline.ts states two obligations in prose: every gated
// file HAS a row ("a gated file without a row here would be judged by
// nothing at all"), and floors only move UP ("the gate will not
// demand it, this file's law does"). Until this spec, NEITHER was
// enforced by anything: the only importers of COVERAGE_BASELINE were
// vitest.config.ts's threshold spread. A dropped or duplicated row
// silently exempts a file from the gate — exactly the failure mode
// the baseline file's own header warns about.
//
// This is a textual/structural pin in the gate-regressions.spec.ts
// style: the gate IS the config, and a regression is a config edit.
